  version: "1.0.0"
  description: >
    The Ollert API provides real-time communication for managing boards, columns, 
    and cards within a collaborative environment. A board represents a project 
    or workflow, containing columns that organize cards into categories or statuses. 
    Cards are individual tasks or activities that can be created, updated, or moved 
    across columns to reflect progress. Built on WebSockets, the API ensures instant 
    updates, enabling seamless collaboration and efficient task management for teams of any size.
